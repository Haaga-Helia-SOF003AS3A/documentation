# Basics
Front-end vs Back-end
The difference is not always perfectly clear
The Front-end is everything what end users see
Common front-end jobs are web designer and user experience designer
The Back-end (server side) defines how the site works like updates, content management etc.
The Back-end development is required to get dynamic sites
During this course we mostly focus on back-end development
